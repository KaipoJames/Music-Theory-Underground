About This Application:
Using pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I aim to increase my development skills by building a project that includes one of my interests.
With the help of external javascript libraries such as howler.js and tonal/js, I learn how to use data from other libraries, use modular javascript, and
increase my problem solving skills. Feel free to offer any suggestions, comments, or questions you may have!
